# Git & GitHub & GitHub flow

## Learning objectives
- Understand the concept of version control.
- Follow GitHub flow.

## What is a version control system? How is it related to Git and GitHub?
A version control system tracks the history of changes to files. It is especially useful in projects built by software development teams.
As the project evolves teams can run tests, fix bugs, and contribute new code with confidence that any version can be recovered at any time.
Reconstructing the edit history of various files can be useful for a variety of reasons, such as when you need to investigate when some change was introduced and why.
Event if you are already familiar with Git and GitHub but it is also important that you understand how they relate to the concept of a version control system.

### Why is it important?
Understanding what Git and GitHub are will make it much easier for you to join a company and get used to their workflow faster, because almost every single company that you can join uses a version control system.

### What's the difference between Git and GitHub?
**Git** is an example of a distributed version control system. **GitHub** is a Git hosting repository that provides developers with tools to ship better code.
Read the [10 minute long introduction article from the Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) and make sure that you understand this difference.

NOTE: Stop yourself from checking all links in this article! Just focuse on the difference for now.

## GitHub flow
GitHub flow is a detailed process for using branches with your team.

***SPOILER ALERT** GitHub flow is slightly different than Gitflow, even though their names look alike.*
*If you look for additional information, please make sure that you are using the correct name - GitHub flow. 

### Why is it important?
If everybody in your team uses the same standard flow, you collaborate more effectively because everyone knows how to track the history of changes in your shared code easily.

### How to use GitHub flow
In order to learn how to use GitHub flow with your team:
- Read this [GitHub Guides article](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) that explains the concept of the GitHub flow with a nice visualization.
